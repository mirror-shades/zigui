this is based off of [zig-javascript-bridge](https://github.com/scottredig/zig-javascript-bridge/) by [scottredig](https://github.com/scottredig)

A library that creates bindings for accessing Javascript from within a WASM runtime, making it easier to call Javascript functions from Zig.

The dev server allows for reactive updates to your site as you build. The project will autocompile each time an src file is changed, and the webpage will reload when the wasm is modified.
